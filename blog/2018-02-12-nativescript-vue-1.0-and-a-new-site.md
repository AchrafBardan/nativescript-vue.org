We are thrilled to announce [NativeScript-Vue 1.0](https://github.com/nativescript-vue/nativescript-vue/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

It has been almost a year since we started this project, and we are finally at a stage where we think the project is ready to be used in production. Although we have been working with NativeScript-Vue and tested many sample applications across devices I'm sure there will be some issues for some users. This release in no way a final release, and we will continue working on improving the developer experience, fixing bugs and last but not least adding new features.

We are very excited about this release! Here are its key features:

- **A brand new documentation site** - We knew that releasing a project without any documentation would be a no-go, so for the past few months we have been writing docs to make using NativeScript-Vue as easy as possible. 
- **Support for most NativeScript Elements** - There are many elements in NativeScript, but we made sure to add almost all of them to NativeScript-Vue and made all the necessary modifications to make them work "the Vue way".

### What's Next?

There are a few plans which we would like to tackle next, there is no timeline for these projects, and we are more than happy to accept community contributions to get them going. 

- **Code Sharing** -  We are working on an official webpack based template that will allow sharing code between your mobile and web application. You can [follow the project on GitHub](https://github.com/nativescript-vue/nativescript-vue-webpack-template)
- **vue-cli 3 support** - The Vue team is working on a completely [new cli tool for Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) which is currently in alpha. We would love to add support for NativeScript-Vue so it can be part of the regular Vue workflow.
